# Writing in the Discipline (WiD)

Make a PR to each studentâ€™s repo for one of the assignments with known issues and them as the assignee.
-	Give a general categorization of the type and number of issues in the assignment
-	Give some guidance on what makes a good PR review in class/reading
- Demo the PR review tools in GitHub
-	They do a review of the PR with comments in the code and an overall comment.
-	Screen shot it and put it in the WiD repo.
-	Do Peer review of the PR reviews???
- Or I just provide feedback?
- Should be class time to work on it!
