# Writing in the Discipline (WiD)

The bug report, comments and PR that you created in the **11-OSS1** [Tutorials](), [Activity]() and [Application]() make up the Writing in the Discipline (WiD) assignment for this course.

## Turning in the work for WiD

After completing all of the 11-OSS1 assignments, you will need to upload PDFs of your bug report, comments and PR to your WiD repository to complete the WiD assignment.

1. Find your WiD repository in the [Dickinson-COMP-WiD Organization](https://github.com/Dickinson-COMP-WiD).
2. Ensure that your WiD repo is well organized.
   - There should be one folder for each course (e.g. COMP132, COMP190, etc...)
   - All content should be stored in the folder for the appropriate course.
2. Create a `COMP290` folder in your Dickinson WiD Repository.
   - Click the "+" button.
   - Select "Create new file".
   - Enter `COMP290/dir` in the box where you "Name your file..."
     - This will create the `COMP290` folder.
     - It also creates an empty file named `dir` inside of `COMP290` because it is not possible to commit an empty directory to a Git repository. We'll delete this file later.
3. Create PDFs with the following names and content:
   - `BugReport.pdf` - The bug report that you created in the issue tracker (from the Tutorials).
   - `BugReport-Comments.pdf` - The bug report that was assigned to you and contains your comments (from the Activity).
   - `PullRequest.pdf` - The PR that you submitted (from the Application).
4. Check that each PDF contains the full description of the issue or PR and all comments that were added by you and/or your peers.
5. Upload each of the PDF's to the `COMP290` folder in your WiD repository.
6. Delete the empty `dir` file that was created in your `COMP290` folder.
