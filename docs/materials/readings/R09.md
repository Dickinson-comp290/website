# Reading 09

Read _Chapter 9: Process_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. What are software processes and what is their purpose?
2. What are some of the software processes that are mentioned in the chapter?
3. Ko cites Brooks as arguing that "adding more people to a project would not necessarily increase productivity." Others have paraphrased Brooks as meaning "adding more people to a project that is behind schedule will make it more behind schedule."
   - What might cause this effect?
4. Ko cites DeMarco and Lister as arguing that "the major challenges in software engineering are human not technical."
    - What do you agree or disagree? Why or why not?
