# Reading 07

Read _Chapter 7: Architecture_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. What is _information hiding_? What is its advantage in _architectural_ designs?
2. Ko describes a number of different architectural designs (_client/server_, _pipe and filter_, _model-view-controller_, _peer_to_peer_, _event-driven_). In what ways do these architectures use information hiding?
3. What is _technical debt_ and what causes it?
