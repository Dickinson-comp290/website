# Reading 11

Read _Chapter 11: Verification_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. What is the distinction between _defects_, _failures_ and _bugs_? Is the distinction important?
2. What are the three main types of automated empirical tests?
3. If you manually test your software as you are writing it you know it works. So then when and why is it worth spending the additional, often significant, time to write automated tests?
