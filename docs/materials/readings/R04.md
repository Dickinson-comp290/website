Read _Chapter 4: Productivity_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. The author says the following about new engineers: "Another dimension of productivity is learning. Great engineers are resourceful, quick learners. New engineers must be even more resourceful, even though their instincts are often to hide their lack of expertise from exactly the people they need help from."
   - When is it time to ask a question?
   - What kinds of things might a manager do to reduce barriers that hold new engineers back from asking questions?
2. There are lots of bold claims about the degree to which AI coding assistants are increasing developer productivity.
   - In what ways do you think these assistants are increasing productivity?
   - Are there any ways in which their use may decrease productivity?
   - What are the potential harms that might arise from their use?
