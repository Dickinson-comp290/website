# Reading 08

Read _Chapter 8: Specifications_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. We have now read about multiple different types of specifications, _designs_, _requirements_, _architectures_, and _functional specifications_. How are these different types of specifications related?
2. What tradeoffs are there in the use of _formal methods_ for writing specifications? What are some systems where they would be most applicable? Least applicable?
3. Can you find an example of "Conway's Law" in this chapter?
