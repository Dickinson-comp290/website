Read _Chapter 6: Requirements_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. What is the distinction between a _design specification_ and _requirements_ of the type discussed in this chapter?
2. What makes a set of requirements good?
3. In October of 2020 Tesla released its "Rolling Stop" feature for its "Full Self-Driving" mode.
   - According to [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22912099/tesla-rolling-stop-disable-recall-nhtsa-update) the "Rolling Stop" feature "allowed Tesla’s cars to “travel through all-way-stop intersections at up to 5.6 mph before coming to a complete stop” if certain criteria are met. These include that there are no “relevant moving cars” and no “relevant pedestrians or bicyclists” near the intersection; that there is “sufficient visibility for the vehicle,” and that roads at the intersection have a speed limit of 30mph or less."

   Evaluate this feature using each of the criteria for "Good Requirements".
