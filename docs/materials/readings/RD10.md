# Reading 09

Read _Chapter 10: Comprehension_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. Ko cites a paper by Maalej and others that claims "most of a software engineer's time is spent reading code."
   - Do you think repeatedly starting from the provided code helped you practice reading (comprehending) code?
2. Ko cites a study by Lawrie and others that claiming that "names are actually critical to facilitating higher level comprehension of program behavior."
   - What are some examples of helpful and unhelpful variable/function naming that you have seen?
3. Ko describes a common situation where senior developers are comfortable asking others to explain code behavior they don't understand, while junior developers are often reluctant do do so "out of fear of looking incompetent" even when it impacts productivity.
   - What strategies might you use to get over a reluctance to ask for help?
