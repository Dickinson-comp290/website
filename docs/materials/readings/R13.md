# Reading 13

Read _Chapter 13: Evolution_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. Ko poses the question "should software companies control when your experience changes or should you?"
   - What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
   - Which do you prefer and why?
2. What are "refactoring", "continuous integration" and "continuous deployment"?  What role does automated testing play in each?
