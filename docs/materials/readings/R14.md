# Reading 14

Read _Chapter 14: Debugging_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. Ko describes a number of debugging strategies:
   - Minimizing failure-inducing inputs.
   - Minimizing the program.
   - Working forward.
   - Working backward.
   - Delta debugging.
  
   How does each of these strategies work? Which have you used successfully in the past?
