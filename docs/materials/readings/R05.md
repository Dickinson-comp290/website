Read _Chapter 5: Quality_ in [Cooperative Software Development](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/cooperative-software-development/) by Amy J. Ko.

Discussion Questions:

1. At the end of the article Ko points out that there can be tradeoffs between the different measures of software quality. She uses Security and learnability, and robustness and maintainability as her examples. What other examples do you see where there would be a tradeoff between the different metrics of software quality?
2. Ko makes the point that the importance of a particular software quality metric depends on the particular application being evaluated. Pick one of your favorite applications and determine which of the quality factors that apply to the use of the software would be the most important to the anticipated users of that software.
